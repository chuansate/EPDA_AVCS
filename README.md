# APU Veterinary Clinic System (AVCS)
APU Veterinary Clinic and Boarding (AVCS) is a growing provider of veterinary care for both domestic and exotic pets. The clinic has 8 vets in total, although on any given day only 3 will be working. Each vet has one or more areas of expertise (ie fish, reptiles, dogs, cats, birds, chickens, horses), therefore one of the challenges that the clinic is facing is trying to ensure the right balance of expertise is available. 

There are 3 types of end users interacting to the required system: 
- Managing staff
- Vets
- Receptionists 

All the end users are required to login for authentication and authorisation purposes.

The following functionalities are provided for the managing staff’s interface:
- To add, delete, search, and update all managing staff’s information. 
- To approve, delete, search, and update all vets’ and receptionists’ information. 
- To create the week's working rota (which vets are working on which days).
- At least 8 vets/ each vet with 1 or 2 expertise / 7 days a week / one day 3 vets cover minimum of 5 expertise (there should be at least one working rota for presentation purposes)
- In addition, some reporting functionality is required. Managing staff would like to get as much useful information from the system as possible and is therefore open to the inclusion of any other useful reports.
At least 5 analyzed reports with visualization charts 
- Generate payslip for the vets = base salary + incentives (staff can adjust the bonus percentage based on the customer ratings) + OT for how long. While generating the payslip, the system will show how many appointments has the vet completed, and what is the average customer rating, then staff can determine the incentives rate!
- Check a list of applications for leave from vets, staffs can accept or reject the application.

The following functionalities are provided for the vets’ interface:
- To register and edit individual profile.
- After completing the appointment, enter the diagnosis and prognosis of each pet seen. Able to view the histories of individual records.
- Vets also need to be able to view their appointments therefore the system should provide each vet with a 'diary' of appointments.
- Vets can see a list of working rota. On the working rota, the vets’ names will be highlighted based on the vet account that is looking at it. 
- Edit the diagnosis and prognosis for the completed appointments
- Based on the scheduled working day (working rota), vets can apply for leave, then staffs can accept or deny the application.

The following functionalities should be provided for the receptionists’ interface:
- To register and edit individual profile.
- Make/edit/cancel appointments. (outside the system, the customers either walk in or call them for appointments. So the customers need profiles, and the profiles are added by receptionists. But the customers can’t use the system.)
- Create customer and pet profiles. (customer profiles must be logical, got name, email address, contact number, gender, and so on.)
- Assign a vet to each appointment.
- After the vets entered the diagnosis and prognosis for each appointment, then the appointment is considered as completed. Then, receptionists can check a list of completed appointments and set a price for each appointment and ask customers to pay, then receptionists have to ask customers for rating the service of the vet for incentives purposes!
- A customer might approach receptionists to ask for a list of medical histories for his/her pet. Note that a customer could have many pets at the same time, the list of medical histories can be based on the diagnoses and prognoses of the past appointments made.
